This section lists problems and solutions that were not
interesting enough to deserve highlighting.

Currently there are no problems and solutions in this section.
Mainly because only one problem has been solved so far.
And partly because not interesting problems are also not so
interesting to solve so I might decide not to solve them
in the first place.
